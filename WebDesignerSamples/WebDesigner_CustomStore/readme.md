# Web Designer ASP.NET Core sample

This sample demonstrates the use of custom resources service for GrapeCity ActiveReports Web Designer with an ASP.NET Core backend.

To use custom store for a designer follow these steps:
1.  Implement `IResourcesService` interface. Also you should implement `IDisposable` interface if you use any unmanaged resources.
2. Implement `ResourceLocator` for your store. It is required for the correct getting report resources (datasets, themes, images, etc).
3. In `GetReport` method redefine report site using implemented resourse locator. See `CustomStoreReports.cs` for more details.
4. In `Startup` class:
   1. Register your implemented `IResourcesService` service.
   2. Call `UseCustomStore` method for viewer (`app.UseReporting`) with `GetReport` method as argument.
   3. Call `UseCustomStore` method for designer (`app.UseDesigner`) with `IResourcesService` implementation as argument.

This case contains two different implementations based on the [LiteDB](https://www.litedb.org/) and [CosmosDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) as an example.

LiteDB implementation is used by default. To try CosmosDB implementation, please, follow [this guide](resources/CosmosDB/howto.md).
